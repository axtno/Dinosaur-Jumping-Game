# Dinosaur Jumping Game on Arduino IDE and LCD
- Attempted to replicate the dinosaur jumping game from Google using an LCD and Arduino IDE. 
- Researched the components of LCD and designed a circuit connected to Elegoo UNO with two buttons for jumping and ducking.
- Assisted in coding the program to run an intro and ending cutscene, transform sprites into byte arrays to project onto the LCD, randomize obstacles, keep a score, and play running, jumping, and ducking animations.
